# EVotingPlatform
This repository contains the project I submitted for my Software Engineering exam during my Bachelor degree.

# Project Description
The project specifications, provided by the professor, are located in the "indicazioni" folder. 

In summary, the task was to develop a software system with specific features to offer an electronic voting service.

# Project Documentation
The entire development process is documented in Italian in the file "relazione progetto.pdf" and all the images in the report are also found in the "images" folder.

I recommend to view the report because it shows step by step the development phases and adopts many of the well-known diagrams used in software engineering
