# EVotingPlatform

# Description
This repository contains the project I submitted for my Software Engineering exam during my Bachelor degree.

The project specifications, provided by the professor, are located in the [indicazioni/testo_progetto_AA2122.pdf](./indicazioni/testo_progetto_AA2122.pdf) folder. 

In summary, the task was to develop a software system with specific features to offer an electronic voting service.

# Documentation
The entire development process is documented in Italian in the file [relazione progetto.pdf](./relazione%20progetto.pdf) and all the images in the report are also found in the "images" folder.

I recommend to view the report because it shows step by step the development phases and adopts many of the well-known diagrams used in software engineering

# Database Setup
To recreate the MySQL database structure import into mySQL PHPMyAdmin the [database dump](./dump%20database/e_voting_platform%20installazione%20pulita.sql)
Maven Project

# code
This is a Maven project, and I have provided the Maven export in the [maven export](./maven%20export/) folder.
